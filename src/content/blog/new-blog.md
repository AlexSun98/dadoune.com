Hey welcome to my new blog, this is my introductory post! If you don't know already, my name is Reed and I love everything that's software and code. I'm starting this blog with the intent that it's primary focus will be related to the coding and software design challenges I encounter on a daily basis. Over the years, the internet has been an invaluable tool to me. It's helped me solve the vast array of problems that I've come across and it's been a vital part in my progression as a software developer. It's a rare day that I don't find myself banging my head against the wall, frustrated by some challenge or another and it's usually the internet who I turn to for help. I've spent hours upon hours reading the posts and tutorials written by others and I feel forever indebted to the great open source community because of it. It's my hope that this blog might be able to give a little bit back by sharing some of the tips and tricks I've learned along the way.
